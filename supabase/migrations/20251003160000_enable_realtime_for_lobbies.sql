  # Enable Realtime for Lobbies Table

  ## Overview
  This migration enables Realtime replication for the lobbies table to ensure
  that participants receive instant notifications when the host starts the game.

  ## Changes

  ### Realtime Configuration
  - Enable replication for the lobbies table
  - Configure publication to include UPDATE events for status changes
  - Ensure proper permissions for realtime subscriptions

  ## Security
  - Realtime subscriptions respect existing RLS policies
  - Only UPDATE events are published to reduce overhead

-- Enable Realtime replication for the lobbies table
-- This ensures that all UPDATE events are broadcast to subscribers

-- Create a trigger to ensure realtime events are properly sent
-- This is a safety measure to ensure status changes are always broadcast

  -- The trigger doesn't need to do anything special
  -- Supabase handles the realtime broadcast automatically
  -- This just ensures the trigger pipeline is active
