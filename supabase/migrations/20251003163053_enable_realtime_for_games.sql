  # Enable Realtime for Games Table

  ## Overview
  This migration enables Realtime replication for the games table to ensure
  that all players receive instant updates when game state changes during gameplay.

  ## Changes

  ### Realtime Configuration
  - Enable replication for the games table
  - Configure publication to include UPDATE events for game state changes
  - Ensure proper permissions for realtime subscriptions

  ## Security
  - Realtime subscriptions respect existing RLS policies
  - Only UPDATE events are published to reduce overhead
